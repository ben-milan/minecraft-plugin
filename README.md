# minecraft-plugin
## This project marks my first step into the world of programming.

Minecraft has been a facinating game for me ever since it came out. And as I realized that I could program my own game modes for the game without using hundreds of command blocks, I decided to start programming my own plugins. Unfortunately, I lost the .jar file on an SSD, but I managed to save the source files, which I believe are more important to showcase my Java knowledge at that point in my life.
